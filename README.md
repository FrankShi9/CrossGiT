# CrossGiT
Stuck at LLM RLHF? Try Next Gen Graph-Image-Text Cross-Modal Transformer

## Elementwise ops parallelism
  broadcasting helps
  
## Uniform Gaussian Attention & random embedding
  no more norm, dropout and handcrafted embedding
  
## Uniform Gaussian Duality Activation
  no more deep stacking and large params
  
## Uniform unit Conv1d for graph, text, audio..
  no more seperate models for each modality
  
## Uniform unit Conv2d for images from camera/radar/lidar..
  no more seperate models for each sensors

## One embedding for all
  add or multiply up to you

## Query is graph, Key is text, Value is image
  even better, you say it
  
## Fusion inside Uniform Attention is 
  Mix of Gaussians (or experts)
