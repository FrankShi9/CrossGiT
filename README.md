# CrossGiT
Next Gen Graph-Image-Text Cross-Modal Transformer von Neumann prototype for quantum and analog computers (even better waiting on you, future of us all)

## Forget Einsum, consider elementwise ops parallelism
  broadcasting helps us all
  
## Uniform Gaussian Attention & random embedding
  no more norm, dropout and handcrafted embedding
  
## Uniform Gaussian Duality Activation
  no more deep stacking and large params
  
## Uniform unit Conv1d for graph, text even audio
  no more seperate models for each modality
  
## Uniform unit Conv2d for images from camera/radar/lidar
  no more seperate models for each sensors

## One embedding for all
  add or multiply up to you

## Query is graph, Key is text, Value is image
  even better, you say it
  
## Fusion inside Uniform Attention is 
  Mix of Gaussians (or experts) you name it..
